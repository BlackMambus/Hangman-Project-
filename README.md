🎮 Hangman Game: Guess the Word, One Letter at a Time!

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that mixes vocabulary skill with suspense. Players try to figure out a secret word by guessing letters—each wrong guess brings them closer to “hanging the man” in the drawing (traditionally represented in stages). It’s simple, addictive, and a fun way to challenge your brain!

Here’s what a digital Hangman game typically includes:

🔠 Secret Word Generator: Picks a random word from a predefined list, often categorized (animals, movies, science terms, etc.).

⌨️ User Input: Players guess one letter at a time.

💣 Strike Limit: You get a limited number of wrong guesses—usually six or seven—before the game ends.

🎨 Visual Feedback: As incorrect guesses build up, parts of the stick figure are drawn—head, body, arms, and legs.

🧠 Hint Option: Some versions offer clues or definitions to make the guessing more engaging.

🏆 Victory or Defeat Screen: Shows whether the word was successfully guessed and reveals it if not.
